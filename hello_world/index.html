        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        
        <em>"I'll sleep when I'm dead"</em>
        
        <p class="space">
            My name is Sophie and I'm always tired. My eyes remain in a state of puffiness during all hours of the day. Catch me on campus constantly squinting.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Hello World" implies you're ready for the day, which I never am. There are never enough hours of sleep to counteract the amount of time spent awake. 
            <br> 
            Every morning I wake up and try to say hello to the world but realize I'm still behind on my hellos from the previous week. 
        </p>
        
        <strong>
            I can break down my reasoning for faulty Hellos into 3 main reasons:
        </strong>
        
        <ul>
          <li>No matter which hour of the day it is, it's always too early</li>
          <li>My night-time routine promotes productivity</li>
          <li>Fuck mornings</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <input type="text" value="If I really thought sleep would help me at this point, I probably would have done it by now. I think it's too late, I'm just perpetually tired forever.">
        
        <br>
        
        <mark>I'll keep trying to stay awake though, at least until I graduate.</mark>
        
        <small> shhhh don't tell my mom I never say hello to the world</small>
        
        <sub> *she'll be pissed</sub>
        
        <p>Even though I suck at saying hello to the world, I still appreciate it just as much as I appreciate my sleep.</p>
        
        <sup>I now consider myself a night person</sup>
