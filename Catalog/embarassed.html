        Didn't sleep much last night? Feeling like Monday morning, but it’s Thursday? Be careful 
not to fall into this slump regularly, or your days 
may be consumed by Cotard’s Delusion.
<br><br>
The Cotard delusion (also Cotard's syndrome 
and walking corpse syndrome) is a rare mental 
illness in which an afflicted person holds the 
delusion that they are dead, either figuratively 
or literally.
<br><br>
In 1880, the neurologist Jules Cotard described 
the condition as "The Delirium of Negation", a psychiatric syndrome 
of varied severity. A mild case is characterized 
by despair and self-loathing, and a severe case 
is characterized by intense delusions of negation 
and chronic psychiatric depression. 
    <br> <br>
In the case of Mademoiselle X describes a 
woman who denied he existence of parts of her 
body and of her need to eat, and said that she 
was condemned to eternal damnation and 
therefore could not die a natural death. In the 
course of suffering "The Delirium of Negation", 
Mademoiselle X died of starvation.
<br><br>
So if you’re not up to eating, or getting up at 
all for that matter, make sure you’re not dead.
