The Jumping Frenchmen of Maine were a group of 19th-century lumberjacks 
who exhibited a rare disorder of unknown origin. The syndrome entails an 
exaggerated startle reflex which may be described as an uncontrollable "jump"; 
individuals with this condition can exhibit sudden movements in all parts of the body. 
Jumping Frenchmen syndrome shares symptoms with other startle disorders.
Individuals with this condition were first found in the northern regions of Maine, 
and were first described by George Miller Beard in 1878.
<br><br>
Beard had a unique interest in unusual disorders and took the opportunity to observe 
the endemic in Maine. He recorded "startle, jumping, and tic-like behaviors" among the 
French Canadians and lumberjacks who lived near Moosehead Lake in northern Maine. He published 
his descriptions of the Jumping Frenchmen in 1880, and he believed the condition was hereditary.
    <br> <br>
George Miller Beard recorded individuals who would obey any command 
given suddenly, even if it meant striking a loved one; the Jumping Frenchmen 
seemed to react abnormally to sudden stimuli. The more common and less intense 
symptoms consisted of jumping, yelling, and hitting. These individuals exhibited 
outrageous bursts, and many described themselves as ticklish and shy.
