        Ever heard of the saying "I'm so bored, I could watch grass grow"? 
        Well just make sure that grass isn't growing on your own body.

Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (also called Lewandowsky-Lutz dysplasia), 
colloquially known as tree man illness is an extremely rare autosomal recessive 
genetic hereditary skin disorder associated with a high risk of carcinoma of the 
skin. It is characterized by abnormal susceptibility to human papillomaviruses
of the skin. The resulting uncontrolled HPV infections result in the growth of 
scaly macules and papules, particularly on the hands and feet.
<br><br>
Clinical diagnostic features are lifelong eruptions of pityriasis versicolor-like 
macules, flat wart-like papules and development of cutaneous carcinomas.
Patients present with flat, slightly scaly, red-brown macules on the face, 
neck and body, recurring especially around the penial area, or verruca-like 
papillomatous lesions, seborrheic keratosis-like lesions, and pinkish-red plane 
papules on the hands, upper and lower extremities, and face.

In November 2007, a video of a 34-year-old Indonesian man named Dede Koswara with a 
similar disease appeared on the Internet. His story appeared on the USA's Discovery 
Channel and TLC series "My Shocking Story" (Extraordinary People on UK's Five) in the 
episode "Half Man Half Tree". On August 12, 2008, Dede Koswara's story was the subject 
of an ABC's Medical Mystery episode entitled "Tree Man". On 26 August 2008, Dede returned 
home following surgery to remove 13 lbs of warts from his body.

Humans already have to shave most of their bodies. Occupy yourself so you're not as bored 
and you won't have to take a lawnmower your body too.
