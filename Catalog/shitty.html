        Medically speaking, “shitty” isn’t necesarily a 
term used to describe a patients emotions. But,
honestly what’s a better word to describe a bad
day? Just because you’re feeling a certain way, 
doesn’t mean you actually want to feel that way.
Coprophobia describes your day to a T (t for 
toilet, that is).
<br><br>
Coprophobia is the fear of feces. This fear might 
have been brought about by a bad experience
in the past, such as when as a child, one was 
not allowed to go to the bathroom by a mean 
teacher and was unable to avoid pooping in 
his underwear inside the classroom. One might 
have also accidently stepped on dog poop 
while walking in the park and getting one’s 
favorite shoes all messy and dirty.
<br><br>
In 1880, the neurologist Jules Cotard described 
the condition as "The Delirium of Negation", a psychiatric syndrome 
of varied severity. A mild case is characterized 
by despair and self-loathing, and a severe case 
is characterized by intense delusions of negation 
and chronic psychiatric depression. 
    <br> <br>
Another reason for the development of 
coprophobia is that fecal material is laden with 
germs and bacteria, thus this phobia can be
linked to bacteriophobia, fear of germs.
<br><br>
So on your extra shitty day, our experts suggest 
staying far away from other beings and if 
possible, the toilet.
