        Ever seen "The Wolf Man"? Filled with anger and distress, one can begin to step out of 
        their own skin and not recognize who they've become...
<br><br>
Hypertrichosis (also called Ambras syndrome) is an abnormal amount of hair growth over the body; 
extensive cases of hypertrichosis have informally been called werewolf syndrome, because the 
appearance is similar to the mythical werewolf. The two distinct types of hypertrichosis are 
generalized hypertrichosis, which occurs over the entire body, and localized hypertrichosis, 
which is restricted to a certain area.
<br><br>
The primary characteristic of all forms of hypertrichosis is excessive hair. Hair in hypertrichosis 
is usually longer than expected and may consist of any hair type (lanugo, vellus, or terminal). 
Patterned forms of hypertrichosis cause hair growth in patterns. Generalized forms of hypertrichosis 
result in hair growth over the entire body. Circumscribed and localized forms lead to hair growth 
restricted to a certain area.

Julia Pastrana (1834â€“1860) traveled throughout the United States in a freak show as the bearded lady, 
capturing the attention of many artists. She is portrayed as having dark extensive hairs distributed equally 
throughout the surface of her body, even on the palms of her hands. Originally, she was believed to have 
congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa; however, the generalized form of the syndrome coupled with her gingival 
hyperlasia indicated that her condition was congenital terminal hypertrichosis. This was not confirmed until after 
her death, when it became clear that her X-linked syndrome resulted in terminal hairs.

So if you're feeling REALLY, REALLY angry, make sure to stay groomed and gel those hairs back!
