Pica is characterized by an appetite for substances that are largely 
non-nutritive, such as ice, paper, clay, drywall or paint, metal, chalk, 
soil, glass, or sand. According to DSM-IV criteria, for these actions to be 
considered pica, they must persist for more than one month at an age where 
eating such objects is considered developmentally inappropriate.
<br><br>
The scant research that has been done on the causes of pica suggests that the 
disorder is a specific appetite caused by mineral deficiency in many cases, such 
as iron deficiency, which sometimes is a result of celiac disease or hookworm infection. 
Often the substance eaten by someone with pica contains the mineral in which that individual 
is deficient. More recently, cases of pica have been tied to the obsessiveâ€“compulsive spectrum, 
and there is a move to consider OCD in the etiology of pica.

In the southern United States in the 1800s, geophagia was a common practice among the slave population. 
Geophagia is a form of pica in which the person consumes earthly substances such as clay, and is particularly 
prevalent to augment a mineral-deficient diet. Research on eating disorders from the 16th century to the 20th 
century suggests that during that time in history, pica was regarded more as a symptom of other disorders rather 
than its own specific disorder. Even today, what could be classified as pica behavior is a normative practice in 
some cultures as part of their beliefs, healing methods, or religious ceremonies.
