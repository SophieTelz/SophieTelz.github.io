        Feeling upset today? Down in the dumps? You may be blue too. No, literally blue.

Argyria or argyrosis is a condition caused by inappropriate
exposure to chemical compounds of the element silver, or to silver dust. The most dramatic symptom of 
argyria is that the skin turns blue or bluish-grey. It may take the form of generalized argyria or local 
argyria. Generalized argyria affects large areas over much of the visible surface of the body. Local argyria 
shows in limited regions of the body, such as patches of skin, parts of the mucous membrane or the conjunctiva.

Since at least the mid-19th century, doctors have known that silver or silver compounds can cause some areas of the 
skin and other body tissues to turn grey or blue-grey. Argyria occurs in people who ingest or inhale silver in 
large quantities over a long period (several months to many years). People who work in factories that manufacture silver 
can also breathe in silver or its compounds. In the past, some of these workers have become argyric. However, the level 
of silver in the air and the length of exposure that caused argyria in these workers is not known.

A prominent case from ingestion of a silver compound (not colloidal silver) was that of Stan Jones of Montana, a Libertarian 
candidate for the United States Senate in 2002 and 2006. The peculiar coloration of his skin was featured prominently in media 
coverage of his unsuccessful campaign, though Jones contended that the best-known photo was "doctored". Jones promised that 
he was not using his silvery complexion as a gimmick. He promoted the use of colloidal silver as a home remedy. He said that 
his good health, excepting the unusual skin tone, is the result of his use of colloidal silver

So if youâ€™re feeling blue, just make sure you're not actually TURNING blue too.
