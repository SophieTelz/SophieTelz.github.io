Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (also known as Todd's syndrome) is a 
disorienting neurological condition that affects human perception. People experience micropsia, macropsia, 
pelopsia, teleopsia, or size distortion of other sensory modalities.
<br><br>
A prominent and often disturbing symptom are experiences of altered body image. The person may find that they 
are confused as to the size and shape of parts of (or all of) their body. They may feel as though their body is 
expanding or getting smaller. Alice in Wonderland syndrome also involves perceptual distortions of the size or 
shape of objects. Other possible causes and signs of the syndrome include migraines, use of hallucinogenic drugs, 
and infectious mononucleosis. Patients with certain neurological diseases have experienced similar visual 
hallucinations. These hallucinations are called "Lilliputian," which means that objects appear either smaller or 
larger than they actually are.
    <br> <br>
The syndrome is sometimes called Todd's syndrome, in reference to an influential description of the condition in 
1955 by Dr. John Todd (1914-1987), who was a British Consultant Psychiatrist at High Royds Hospital at Menston in 
West Yorkshire. Todd discovered that several of his patients experienced severe migraine headaches causing them to 
see and perceive objects as greatly out of proportion. They have altered sense of time and touch, as well as distorted 
perceptions of their own body. Although having migraine headaches, none of these patients had brain tumours, damaged eyesight, 
or mental illness that could have caused similar symptoms. They were also all able to think lucidly and could distinguish 
hallucinations from reality. But their perceptions were skewed.
